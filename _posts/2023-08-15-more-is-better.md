> A new era of personalized medicine has arrived, which proposes an individualized health care model with tailored medical target treatment and management for each patient (Chin et al., 2011). Under this regime, not only clinical profiles of patients but also their molecular profiles are personally managed to drive for advanced treatment. Cancer studies that are focused on one-dimensional omics data have only provided limited information regarding the etiology of oncogenesis and tumor progression. To overcome this, tremendous efforts have been made to obtain multi-platform based genomic data from biospecimen.

An excellent background introduction for imitating writing. It's better to use specific cases to depict the application scenarios rather than solely emphasize the importance. (Question: how to find or imagine the actual application? Especially when the topic came from a minor issue, though it's indeed helping for something, it's hard to make it both specific and not too niche.)

_multi-platform based molecular profiles_ kind of looks like social network and user portrait, so maybe we can transfer some technics between them.

> However, human genomes are complex and regulated at multiple levels, which can be manifested by various genomic assays mentioned above. While each of these assays offers a peek of the complex system, these events are rather interdependent (or interactive). Thus, when combining several different omics data to discover the coherent biological signatures, it is challenging to incorporate different biological layers of information to predict phenotypic outcomes (tumor/normal, early/late stage, survival, etc.). It is herein our goal to address the pressing and challenging issues for developing novel algorithms and theoretical methods for multi-omics data integration, in the hope to extract biologically meaningful information of clinical relevance.
