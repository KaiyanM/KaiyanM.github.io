> A new era of personalized medicine has arrived, which proposes an individualized health care model with tailored medical target treatment and management for each patient (Chin et al., 2011). Under this regime, not only clinical profiles of patients but also their molecular profiles are personally managed to drive for advanced treatment. Cancer studies that are focused on one-dimensional omics data have only provided limited information regarding the etiology of oncogenesis and tumor progression. To overcome this, tremendous efforts have been made to obtain multi-platform based genomic data from biospecimen.

An excellent background introduction for Imitate writing. Use specific cases to depict the application scenarios rather than solely emphasize the importance. (Question: how to find or imagine the actual application? Especially when the topic came from a minor issue, though it's indeed helping for something, it's hard to make it both specific and not too niche.)

`multi-platform based molecular profiles` kinda looks like social network and user portrait, so maybe we can transfer some technics between them.
