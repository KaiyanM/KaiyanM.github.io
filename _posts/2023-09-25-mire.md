I'm not usually a fan of geology, but I would be happy to write down this 10-second trivia. When reciting GRE words, I found lots of vocabulary in nature science can be placed into vibrant expressions metaphorically, which came as a surprise to me under the impression that these words are rarely used. After seeing several words stand for both mud and plight in succession, my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped and googled for their exact meanings. Here is the difference between swamp, bog, mire, and marsh.
