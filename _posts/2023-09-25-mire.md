I found that lots of vocabulary in nature science can be placed into vibrant expressions metaphorically when reciting GRE words, which came as a surprise to me under the impression that these terms are almost rarely used. After seeing several words stand for both mud and plight in succession, my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped and googled for their exact meanings. I'm not usually a fan of geology, but I would like to share this 10-second trivia. Here is the difference between swamp, bog, mire, and marsh.
